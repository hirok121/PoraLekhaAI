# Mathematical Physics Routing Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the AI tutoring system's routing and classification mechanisms to properly identify and handle complex mathematical physics problems, specifically parametric motion equations and calculus-based physics problems.

## Problem Identified

The original system was missing complex mathematical physics questions like:

> "A particle moves along a curve in 3D space defined by the parametric equations:
> x(t) = 2cos(3t) + t²
> y(t) = 3sin(2t) - e^(-t/2)  
> z(t) = t³ - 4t + ln(t+1)"

These questions require advanced mathematical analysis including:

- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Vector analysis (velocity, acceleration, jerk)
- 3D motion analysis
- Complex function combinations

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Query Classifier (`fast_track_agent.py`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Added **Mathematical Physics Indicators** section with priority detection rules
- Enhanced recognition of parametric equations with time variables
- Added detection for calculus operations (derivatives, integrals, differential equations)
- Improved recognition of vector calculus concepts
- Added specialized handling for complex function combinations

**New Detection Patterns:**

```json
{
  "detected_mathematical_concepts": [
    "parametric_equations",
    "calculus",
    "vector_analysis"
  ],
  "estimated_processing_time": "complex",
  "classification": "COMPLEX_EDUCATIONAL"
}
```

**Critical Detection Rules:**

- ANY parametric equations with functions of t → COMPLEX

  "requires_calculus": true,
  "requires_vector_analysis": true,
  "physics_content_type": "kinematics",
  "preserved_expressions": ["x(t) = 2cos(3t) + t²", "e^(-t/2)", "ln(t+1)"]
}
```
