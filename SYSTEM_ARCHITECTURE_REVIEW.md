- Clear instructions and descriptions for each agent
- Consistent implementation across all agents

### ✅ Integration Testing

- System runs without validation errors
- Agent transfer mechanisms work correctly
- State management functions properly

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Agent Design Patterns

- **Coordinator/Dispatcher**: ConversationRouterAgent manages initial routing
- **Sequential Pipeline**: AnalysisPipelineAgent → QuestionAnalyzerAgent → SolutionPipelineAgent
- **Hierarchical Task Decomposition**: Multi-level agent tree for complex educational tasks

### 2. Communication Mechanisms

- **LLM-Driven Delegation**: Used for intelligent routing decisions
- **Shared Session State**: Enables data flow between pipeline stages
- **Clear Agent Descriptions**: Facilitate proper LLM-driven routing

### 3. Modularity and Maintainability
