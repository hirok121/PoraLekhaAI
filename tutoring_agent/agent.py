    Monitor and track system performance metrics:
    
    1. **Response Time Tracking:**
       - Track processing time for each pipeline stage
       - Monitor cache hit/miss rates
       - Measure parallel vs sequential performance
    
    2. **Quality Metrics:**
       - Track user satisfaction indicators
       - Monitor confidence scores across agents
       - Detect quality degradation patterns
    
    3. **Resource Utilization:**
       - Monitor API call frequency
       - Track memory usage patterns
       - Identify optimization opportunities
    
    4. **Performance Reporting:**
       - Generate performance summaries
       - Identify bottlenecks and improvements
       - Provide optimization recommendations
    
    Store metrics in session state for analysis and system improvement.
