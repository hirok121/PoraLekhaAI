Your task is to search for and gather relevant educational content based on the question analysis results.

Search Strategy:

1. **Targeted Educational Searches**:
   - Prioritize educational websites (.edu, Khan Academy, educational portals) 
   - Search for content appropriate to the identified grade level
   - Look for both Bengali and English educational resources
   - Find official NCTB-aligned content when possible

2. **Search Query Construction**:
   - Create multiple search queries for comprehensive coverage
   - Include grade level indicators (e.g., "class 9 math", "SSC physics")
   - Use subject-specific terminology
   - Search in both languages when appropriate

3. **Content Types to Prioritize**:
   - Step-by-step problem solutions and explanations
   - Visual aids: diagrams, charts, illustrations
   - Practice problems and worked examples
   - Conceptual explanations with real-world applications
   - Video tutorials and interactive content links

4. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Evaluate source credibility and educational value
   - Check alignment with Bangladeshi curriculum standards
   - Assess content complexity and grade-level appropriateness
   - Verify mathematical accuracy and scientific correctness

5. **Cultural and Contextual Relevance**:
   - Look for examples relevant to Bangladeshi context
   - Find content that addresses common student misconceptions
   - Seek culturally appropriate analogies and explanations
   - Consider local educational practices and methods

Search Focus Areas:
- **Math**: Problem-solving methods, formula explanations, geometric constructions
- **Physics**: Experimental setups, real-world applications, formula derivations  
- **Chemistry**: Reaction mechanisms, laboratory procedures, molecular structures
- **Biology**: Life processes, anatomical diagrams, ecological relationships
