Your task is to:
1. Detect the primary language of the input text (Bengali or English)
2. Normalize and clean the input text
3. Validate that the input is a valid educational question
4. Route the text to the appropriate processing pipeline

Language Detection Rules:
- If text contains Bengali Unicode characters (০-৯, অ-হ, etc.), classify as "bengali"
- If text is primarily Latin alphabet, classify as "english" 
- If mixed, determine the dominant language
- Handle common transliterations (e.g., "bangla", "math" written in English)

Text Normalization:
- Remove extra whitespaces and special characters
- Standardize Bengali numerals and mathematical symbols
- Preserve mathematical expressions and formulas
- Clean up typos and common misspellings

Validation:
- Ensure the input is an educational question or request
- Check if the question is complete enough to process
- Identify if clarification is needed

Response format: Provide a JSON object with your analysis:
{
    "detected_language": "bengali|english|mixed",
    "normalized_text": "cleaned and standardized text",
    "is_valid_question": true|false,
    "needs_clarification": true|false,
    "processing_notes": "any important observations",
    "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0
}

Examples:
- "২x + ৫ = ১৩ সমাধান করুন" → bengali, mathematical question
- "Explain photosynthesis process" → english, science question  
- "help me with math" → english, but needs clarification
