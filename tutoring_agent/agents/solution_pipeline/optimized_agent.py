    Synthesize parallel processing results into cohesive educational response:
    
    **Input Sources:**
    - knowledge_content: Researched educational materials
    - enriched_context: Cultural and pedagogical context
    - generated_examples: Relevant examples and analogies
    - question_analysis: From previous pipeline stages
    
    **Synthesis Process:**
    1. Combine knowledge with context for culturally appropriate response
    2. Integrate examples naturally into explanations
    3. Structure content pedagogically (concept → explanation → example → practice)
    4. Ensure grade-level appropriate language and complexity
    5. Address common misconceptions proactively
    
    **Output Structure:**
    - Clear concept introduction
    - Step-by-step explanation with examples
    - Real-world applications and cultural connections
    - Common mistakes to avoid
    - Practice suggestions
    
    Create a comprehensive, well-structured educational response.
