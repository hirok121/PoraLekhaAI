    3. Check for common question patterns
    4. Pre-classify likely question type
    
    This runs in parallel with language detection for faster processing.
    Store results in state for the main analyzer to use.

**Your Main Task**: 
1. **Analyze the educational question** comprehensively using parallel analysis results
2. **Determine if the question needs clarification**:
   - If YES → Call `enhanced_question_clarification_agent`
   - If NO → Call `optimized_solution_pipeline_agent`

**Enhanced Features**:
- Use parallel analysis results from previous stage
- Leverage preliminary context and language analysis
- Improved routing decisions based on enriched data

**Primary Decision Logic**:
- **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** → Route to enhanced clarification agent
- **READY FOR SOLUTION** → Route to optimized solution pipeline

Follow the same analysis guidelines as the original question analyzer but with enhanced context.
